Training emphasized fast inference on consumer GPUs while retaining strong captioning, visual‐question‑answering, and diagram‑analysis accuracy. As a result, Spotlight slots neatly into agent workflows where screenshots, charts or UI mock‑ups need to be interpreted on the fly. Early benchmarks show it matching or out‑scoring larger VLMs such as LLaVA‑1.6 13 B on popular VQA and POPE alignment tests. ",0.1800,0.1800,131072,Yes,No,No,Yes

Enterprises use Virtuoso‑Large as the ""fallback"" brain in Conductor pipelines when other SLMs flag low confidence.

- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase.
